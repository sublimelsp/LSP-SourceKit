# LSP-SourceKit

This is a helper package that automatically configures [Apple's SourceKit](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp) language server for you.

To use this package, you must have:

- The [LSP](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP) package.
- [Swift toolchain](https://www.swift.org/install/). In case of macOS it comes with Xcode. In case of linux install correct variant for your distribution and make it available in system's `$PATH`.
- A [Swift-Next](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Swift%20Next) syntax.

## Applicable Selectors

This language server operates on views with base scopes:

- `source.c` (C files)
- `source.c++` (C++ files)
- `source.objc` (Objective-C files)
- `source.objc++` (Objective-C++ files)
- `source.swift` (Swift files)

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> The server is disabled globaly by default, you should either override its global setting to `"enabled": true,` or run in command palette `LSP: Enable language server in project` to enable it on per-project basis.

SourceKit will expect either a `compile_commands.json` file at the root of your project, or a `Package.swift` file if project built around the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/getting-started/#using-the-package-manager).
In case of `compile_commands.json`, this file is usually generated by CMake with the command-line option `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON`.

## Configuration

Configure SourceKit by running `Preferences: LSP-SourceKit` from the command palette.
