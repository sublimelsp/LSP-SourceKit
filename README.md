# LSP-SourceKit

This is a helper package that automatically configures [Apple's SourceKit](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp) language server for you.

To use this package, you must have:

- The [LSP](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP) package.
- For macOS: Xcode and/or its command-line tools; for Linux: Install [sourcekit-lsp](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp) manually.
- A Swift syntax if you want to use this server on Swift files. You may want to try [Swift-Next](https://github.com/Swift-Next/Swift-Next).

## Applicable Selectors

This language server operates on views with base scopes:

- `source.swift` (Swift files)

## Usage

SourceKit will expect either a `compile_commands.json` file at the root of your project, or a project built around the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/getting-started/#using-the-package-manager).
In case of `compile_commands.json`, this file is usually generated by CMake with the command-line option `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON`.

For Linux users: modify the `"command"` value in the settings to point to the `sourcekit-lsp` executable.

## Installation Location

Nothing is installed. The plugin will use the language server bundled with Xcode on macOS.

## Configuration

Configure SourceKit by running `Preferences: LSP-SourceKit` from the command palette.
